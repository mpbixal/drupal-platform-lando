# Configuration of the build of this application.
build:

  # when this builds locally for the first time, it will install composer 2 in
  # .platform/local/deps/php but for some reason, it does not see it and uses
  # the old /usr/local/bin. It's probably because whatever puts composer in $path
  # does not fire after composer 2 is installed, but before.
